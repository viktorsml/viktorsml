I'm a full-stack software developer based in Puerto Vallarta.

I'm comfortable throughout the stack, but my passion lies in the front end, at the intersection of code and design. Previously, I've studied software engineering at Tec MM Campus Vallarta.

> 🔭 *I usually work on several projects, but I’ll be happy to discuss new opportunities. Let’s get in touch!*
